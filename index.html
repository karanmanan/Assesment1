<h1 style="color: #FFFFFF;">Personal Information</h1>
<p style="color: #FFFFFF;">I am currently a student at RMIT university studying Bachelor of Information Technology. I grew up in the state of Punjab in northern India and moved to Australia in 2016. I am fluent in Punjabi, Hindi, and English. I enjoy playing soccer and am the most over confident and lazy being on this planet.

<h1 style="color: #FFFFFF;">Interest in IT</h1>
<p style="color: #FFFFFF;">I find it exciting to create programs which can save everyone’s time and improve efficiency. I choose IT because I was always interested in hacking and coding, but I also appreciate the fact that there is high job security in this field.

<h1 style="color: #FFFFFF;">Ideal Job</h1>
<p style="color: #FFFFFF;">I want to become an ethical hacker because I find it exciting to breach a software’s security by attacking weaknesses and then come up with measures to make the software more secure. Hackers need to learn a range of programming languages and have strong SQL skills. The payrate for hackers in good and they can work interernationally very easily. Being a hacker means always improving your skills. Hackers frequently practice in virtual environments and have to learn many languages.

<h1 style="color: #FFFFFF;">Project Ideas</h1>
<p style="color: #FFFFFF;">I want to create a chess game with an AI ranging in difficulty. The AI will be capable of calculating several moves it and its opponent can take, and figure out the best possible course to take. It will also have adaptive qualities for cases when something don't go as planned. I want to create a 3D chess game, but that's something I will need to work really hard on because I've never done any 3D animation before. The game will also have a Player Vs Player mode where two players can play on the same computer. I will use c++ to create this game because it is the what is used to create most of the games nowdays and 3D animation can be doen efficiently using this language.
